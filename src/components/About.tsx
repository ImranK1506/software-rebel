                <p>
                  Started as a self-taught developer with an insatiable curiosity for how things work. 
                  Quickly discovered that the web was my canvas and code was my paintbrush.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From building scrappy prototypes to architecting complex single-page applications, 
                  I've learned that great software isn't just about the tech stackâ€”it's about 
                  solving real problems for real people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, I specialize in React ecosystems, modern JavaScript, and creating 
                  performant, accessible web applications that scale. But more than that, 
                  I'm passionate about mentoring teams and establishing best practices that 
                  last beyond any single project.
